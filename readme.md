# Global Cumulative CO2 Emissions
#### Created by Lilly Baer
# Project Description
This is an interactive web map that displays the carbon dioxide emissions of 256 countries from the year 1750-2022 in total tons. The purpose is to demonstrate the differences in impacts each country has on climate change.

## Symbology
The map type is a choropleth map, with a gradient of orange to red as quantities increse. Grey areas are areas where data was unavailble, predominantly disputed territories.

## Sources
A Leaflet basemap was utilized, along with a world shapefile from Open Data Soft. The CO2 data was retrieved from Our World in Data, and this was joined with the shapefile on geojson.io. Visual Studio Code was used to write the code and compile the data.
